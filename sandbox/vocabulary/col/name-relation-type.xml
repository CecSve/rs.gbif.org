  <concept dc:identifier="spelling-correction"
           dc:URI="http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/terms/col/name-relation-type#spelling-correction"
           dc:description="The name is a spelling correction, called emendation in zoology, of the related name having the same type. Intentional changes in the original spelling of an available name, whether justified or unjustified. The binomial authority remains unchanged. Valid emendations include changes made to correct:  a) typographical errors in the original work describing the species,  b) errors in transliteration from non-Latin languages,  c) names that included diacritics, hyphens  d) endings of species to match the gender of the generic name, particularly when the combination has been changed\nFor example, Hieronima and Hyeronima are orthographical variants of Hieronyma. One of the spellings must be treated as the correct one. In this case, the spelling Hieronyma has been conserved and is to be used as the correct spelling.\nBotany (Article 61).: An inadvertent use of one of the other spellings has no consequences: the name is to be treated as if it were correctly spelled.\nZoology (Art. 32-33 ): Orthographical variants in the formal sense do not exist; a misspelling or orthographic error is treated as a lapsus, a form of inadvertent error. The first reviser is allowed to choose one variant for mandatory further use, but in other ways, these errors generally have no further formal standing.">
