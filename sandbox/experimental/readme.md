## Experimental

This section contains schemas to be used as GBIF explore enabling the IPT to support richer data formats.
These may change or disappear at short notice, so should be used with caution.

The schemas are presented using [Frictionless table schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) definitions as a first exploration.
