## Experimental

This section contains schemas to be used for exploring richer data support in the IPT.
These may change or disappear at short notice, so should be used with caution.

The schemas are presented using [Frictionless Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) definitions as a first exploration.
