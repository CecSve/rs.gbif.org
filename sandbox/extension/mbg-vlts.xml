Calculate the bearing from 0 toward 359.999 degrees offset clockwise from 0 degrees, where 0 = 360 degrees.  Assuming the platform is traveling forwards, the line of travel on the trackline, which is the front of the platform (e.g. bow of ship or front of plane) is at zero degrees bearing.

This information is linked to the information in observationLocation. observationHeight and reticles is used to calculate the radial distance from the vessel to the animals.
