					the scheme's arrangement compromises between a politically and a phytogeographically oriented system. 
					It identifies geographic units worldwide in a four-level hierarchy, incorporating continents, regions, provinces and countries.

Spatial entities provided by Yahoo! GeoPlanet are referenced by a 32-bit identifier: the Where On Earth ID (WOEID). 
WOEIDs are unique and non-repetitive, and are assigned to all entities within the system. 
A WOEID, once assigned, is never changed or recycled. 
If a WOEID is deprecated it is mapped to its successor or parent WOEID, so that requests to the service using a deprecated WOEID are served transparently.

  					Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World is a biogeographic regionalization of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity

					There are 867 terrestrial ecoregions, classified into 14 different biomes such as forests, grasslands, or deserts. 
					Ecoregions represent the original distribution of distinct assemblages of species and communities.

  				<td>
This dataset represents a partition of the world oceans into provinces as defined by Longhurst, A.R. (2006). Ecological Geography of the Sea. 2nd Edition. Academic Press, San Diego, 560p.
They are based on the prevailing role of physical forcing as a regulator of phytoplankton distribution. 
Note that the boundaries of these provinces are not fixed in time and space, but are dynamic and move under seasonal and interannual changes in physical forcing. 
At the first level of reduction, Longhurst recognised four principal biomes (also referred to as domains in earlier publications): 
the Polar Biome, the Westerlies Biome, the Trade-Winds Biome, and the Coastal Boundary Zone Biome. 
These four Biomes are recognisable in every major ocean basin. 
At the next level of reduction, the ocean basins are partitioned into provinces, roughly ten for each basin. 
These partitions provide a template for data analysis or for making parameter assignments on a global scale.

GADM is a spatial database of the location of the world's administrative areas (or adminstrative boundaries) for use in GIS and similar software. 
Administrative areas in this database are countries and lower level subdivisions such as 
provinces, departments, bibhag, bundeslander, daerah istimewa, fivondronana, krong, landsvæðun, opština, sous-préfectures, counties, and thana. 
GADM describes where these administrative areas are (the "spatial features"), and for each area it provides some attributes, such as the name and variant names.
